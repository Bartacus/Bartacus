Bartacus Documentation
======================

Bartacus aims to integrate the Symfony full stack framework into the TYPO3 CMS
to gain all the advantages from Symfony, like Twig rendering and a really good
DI container. Depending on your knowledge and previous experience you will
like it more than Extbase and Fluid.
